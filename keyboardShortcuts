Here are some I use frequently (you can replace right arrow with left arrow to go in the opposite direction):

1) End of line (opposite: beginning of line): 

(MacOS) CMD + → 

(Windows) Fn + → is most common, but depends on your keyboard. Look for the "End" key

2) Highlight upcoming word (opposite: highlight previous word)

(MacOS) ALT + SHIFT + →

(Windows) CTRL + SHIFT + →

3) Search for a word in the current file / page (works on web browsers and other programs too)

(MacOS) CMD + F

(Windows) CTRL + F

4) Un-indent a line

(MacOS / Windows) SHIFT + TAB

5) Comment multiple lines (can also be used to add a comment to a single line)

(MacOS) CMD + /

(Windows) CTRL + /

6) Search for packages (many but not all text editors support this)

(MacOS) CMD + SHIFT + P

(Windows) CTRL + SHIFT + P
